Georgiou K., Koven C. D., Wieder W. R., Hartman M. D., Riley W. J., Pett-Ridge J., Bouskill N. J., Abramoff R. Z., Slessarev E., Ahlström A., Parton W. J., Pellegrini A. F. A., Pierson D., Sulman B. N., Zhu Q., Jackson R. B. Emergent temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon driven by mineral associations. _Nature Geoscience_, 2024.

In this manuscript, we analyzed (i) an observationally-derived global data product and (ii) model output from CMIP6 Earth system models and offline land models to quantify the distribution of carbon between underlying soil organic matter pools and their respective climatological temperature sensitivities. Here we provide the R and Python scripts to perform the analyses.
